ZorgPlayers
===========

The Zorg team was a team which developed a player for the CodeGuru Xtreme competition of 2012.
Our players got to the 1st place in the competition.

We want to share our players with their source codes and comments, and hope that it will be of any help to
other teams in the future.

You will see many players in this repo. Each has a short description in its beginning to explain its main idea.
We developed them along the way and left the older ones when we had a better idea.

The name Zorg emerged when we thought we had a need to have the last turn in the game. Therefore, we chose a name
which is as far as we can into the ABC.

Zorg (which is actually spelled Zurg) is the name of the "bad guy" of "Toy Story". We spelled it Zorg since we thought
that more people will read it correctly like this.
